Tech-savy family members tried to stop me, since SWEs back in the day were treated like absolute peasants with shit pay. They obviously have failed.<p>I got extremely lucky that I started my career in the middle of the tech industry boom. IMO, BigTech paying ridiculous amount of compensation made sense until they &#39;corporatified&#39; themselves.<h2 id=current-situation>Current situation</h2><p>Here is a list of personally-interested recent layoffs:<ul><li>Google, 12000, 2023/01/20<li>Wayfair, 1750, 2023/01/20<li>Microsoft, 10000, 2023/01/18<li>Coinbase, 950, 2023/01/10<li>Amazon, 8000, 2023/01/04</ul><p>.. And layoffs are ongoing. BigTech is shedding workforce like there is no tomorrow.<p>Cash in hand remains strong for some companies (Microsoft, Google) but not for many (Meta, Amazon, Netflix).<h2 id=my-expectations>My expectations</h2><p>Without much proof to back it up in this blog post, I foresee the recession to start easing off around 2023Q4 and recover to &#39;normal&#39; levels by the end of 2024.<p>Given this:<ul><li>I think Meta will have a major layoff and reduction in size, I don&#39;t see a way for them to accelerate their investment in VR/MR to power through the recession. The cash in hand doesn&#39;t seem enough to survive without any major layoffs. I expect the company size to reduce by 60% (vs during-covid size) at minimum.<li>Big staff increase and diversification in cheaper countries (ie. outside US).<li>A lot of startups will die, and lots of new ones will start. Startup scene will now focus on sustainability and profitability instead of focusing on being bought off by BigTech.<li>Compensation growth and awards will be significantly lower, or more layoffs.<li>All IC will start praying their VP gets fired and get merged to a better department.</ul><h2 id=preparing>Preparing</h2><ul><li>Be under the management chain who can give you the work experience that you expect. Ideally, this should stretch up to your department&#39;s VP level. Keep them happy and they&#39;ll shield you from BS.<li>Be actually good at the job. As much as I hate to say it, there are tonnes of engineers in BigTech who are terrible at everything other than writing descent code or designing simple systems that is pointless because BigTech has outgrown such design needs.<li>Lower cost of living, obviously. Consider working remotely in a more affordable area.<li>Buy a home to live in, if you haven&#39;t already.</ul><p>Good luck to 2023-2024 graduates, consider doing more studies if you can afford to.<h2 id=long-term-thinking>Long-term thinking</h2><ul><li>Don&#39;t make working in BigTech one of your personalities.<li>Grow your career in the pace you can manage. The higher profile and paid you are, more likely you stand out when cost cutting. Unless you are buddies with the SVPs, you are just a cog in the machine.</ul><p>I guess TLDR for this is, stay humble and don&#39;t let your ego consume you.</div><footer><hr><p>2020-2023 Copyright.
