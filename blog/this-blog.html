It got things done, and I was happy. Although I was never happy how sloggy it was, I knew nothing about web development so I dealt with it.<h2 id=my-second-blog>My second blog</h2><p>During uni, I picked up web development quite quickly. Naturally, I decided write my own blog.<p>It had fancy frontend web-dev things with React and SCSS, following the best industry practices to making an webapp. The goal was to develop a webapp-ish experience with my online resume. Not long after creating it, I found a couple of problems:<ol><li>I soon grew to hate all these frontend tools.<li>Writing a new blog post in raw HTML was painful.<li>It felt bloated for what it was doing.<li>The original blog name became too nerdy for me to accept. I really liked it back then, but the name made me focus on only tech-related things instead of wide range of things I wanted to discuss.<li>I decided I wanted some anonymity online. I wanted a new &#39;profile&#39; for me to use without it being tied to existing social accounts.</ol><p>I ditched the blog quite shorty after. This blog is not even hosted anymore.<h2 id=this-blog>This blog</h2><p>This blog is essentially the iteration of the second, keeping things I liked and fixing the issues.<ol><li>It is fast and minimal - it is just raw HTML and CSS. No JS (although, if I ever decide to enable commenting, it will inevitably have JS).<li>Blogging is done in Markdown - this makes my life easier. To be exact, I write in markdown but have freedom to use just plain old html whenever I want to :)<li>Minimal development workflow - just a few Node packages (mainly <a href=https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml>posthtml</a>).</ol><p>To check out the implementation, visit <a href=https://github.com/notcodingtoday/blog>github.com/notcodingtoday/blog</a>.<p>Hopefully, this is my last iteration. I hope to fill this blog with my game dev, music and other nerdy software engineering things.<p>Cheers.</div><footer><hr><p>2020 Copyright. All Rights Reserved.</footer>
