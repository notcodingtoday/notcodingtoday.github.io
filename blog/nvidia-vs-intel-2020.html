Intel was a salty jealous boi calling names.<h2 id=nvidia-rtx-30-series>Nvidia RTX 30 series</h2><p>Given that RTX 20 series <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series>launched back in 2018</a>, a refresh in the product was somewhat expected. But the unexpected high performance increase was a happy surprise for everyone:<div class=youtube><iframe src=https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E98hC9e__Xs frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>tl;dw: you get the best performing card in previous gen for USD$499 in new generation. Nvidia also flexed 8k@60fps with RTX 3090 (ie. Titan).<h3 id=well-announced>Well-announced</h3><p>I can&#39;t find anything wrong with the Nvidia launch video. It is focused, the tech is well described (just deep enough) and features are presented well.<p>Nvidia later on released <a href=https://youtu.be/A7nYy7ZucxM>more gameplay comparison videos</a> to further solidify their performance claims.<h3 id=why-is-it-so-much-better-vs-last-gen>Why is it so much better vs last gen?</h3><p>I have a couple of theories:<ol><li>RTX 20 sales were <a href=https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-20-sales-lower-than-expected-45-percent-revenue-decline/ >underwhelming</a> and Nvidia wanted to regain attention.<li>Rumored AMD&#39;s Big Navi performs on par with RTX 3070 (ie. on par with RTX 2080Ti). Check out <a href=https://youtu.be/9zJL99lb7F4>Moore&#39;s Law Is Dead video</a> regarding rumored Big Navi performance.<li>Nvidia is trying to prevent PC customers from switching to new console generation.</ol><p>Whatever the reasons are, performance-per-dollar seems to be amazing with RTX 30 - which is obviously great for consumers.<h2 id=intel-tiger-lake>Intel Tiger Lake</h2><p>Intel is losing CPU market share to AMD. <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/ >Steam HW survey</a> reflects this in PC gaming market. Recent AMD laptops <a href=https://youtu.be/4V3uB12mRrU>dwarves Intel alternatives</a> in performance and battery life. AMD server hardware is <a href=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/netflix-amd-epyc-vs-intel-xeon-servers>significantly more tempting</a> even in layman&#39;s view.<p>Intel, not surprisingly, decided to steal the show from AMD - who announced the octa-core 4800U about 8 months ago:<div class=youtube><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Kv4QF1_t-o frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h3 id=textbook-of-bad-announcements>Textbook of bad announcements</h3><p>The product stack seems solid and powerful. But unlike Nvidia&#39;s reveal, entire video tone can be summarized as &#39;jealous boomer whining&#39;.<p>Literally 5 minutes in, Intel is name-calling AMD as <em>imitators</em>. I am guessing Intel is calling out AMD&#39;s CPU naming scheme. Then, does copying AMD64 instruction make Intel an imitator? How about Intel coping bigLittle design (ie. Intel glue)? Anyway, only <em>imitators</em> use benchmarks, but Intel plans to be the best in benchmarks (watch <code>05:04</code> of the video for a good laugh).<p>I don&#39;t want this post to turn into &#39;10 pages how Intel is unproductively whining&#39;, so I&#39;ll just stop here.<p>To be fair, I get that Intel is scared of AMD. I&#39;d also want to drive AMD out of mobile market while they are still new before desktop history repeats itself in mobile.<h3 id=easy-things-intel-can-fix>Easy things Intel can fix</h3><p>I&#39;d never accept my work presented in such an unprofessional presentation. I am sure many Intel engineers agree. I think Intel can fix this easily:<ol><li>Pre-record the announcement. None of their talent has good stage performance.<li>Stop mentioning AMD, ever. The best way to make a man-child behave is by removing the trigger.<li>Don&#39;t follow-up on AMD&#39;s announcements. AMD also does petty things in their presentations (misleading graphs, for example - which Intel definitely did here).</ol><h2 id=two-announcements-one-winner>Two announcements, one winner</h2><p>I think the videos got more eyeballs than usual thanks to 2020 being the year of staying indoors and few releases - ie. Intel&#39;s PR failure got amplified thanks to COVID. That said, if there wasn&#39;t Nvidia&#39;s announcement, Intel&#39;s failure would not have looked this bad.. May be not.</div><footer><hr><p>2020-2023 Copyright. All Rights Reserved.</footer>
